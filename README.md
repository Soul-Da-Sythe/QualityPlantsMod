Hey, this is a quick mod that makes it so whenever a seed is planted, its quality changes depending on its pot.

- **Grow Tent** = Trash Quality
- **Cheap Plastic Pot** = Poor Quality
- **Moisture-Preserving Pot** = Standard Quality
- **Air Pot** = Premium Quality

Additives work as normal, so you can directly grow Legendary plants with an Air Pot and some Fertilizer.

I feel this makes the quality system more salient during gameplay because tbh I personally never had to worry about it, I just started making Legendary product for funsies. 

UPDATE: changed the Drying Rack to unlock at the same time as the Plastic Pot. Now i just have to update the warehouse unlock. kinda stupid you cant purchase plastic pots when you unlock them. When you unlock the warehouse you already have access to the Moisture-Preserving Pots, rendering them useless imo.

I created this mod with [Quality Bonus](https://www.nexusmods.com/schedule1/mods/314) by ms1m in mind.

Look out for future quality mods, might be slow as I have no idea what I'm doing.
